# Gary
Gary the Gyarados is a Discord bot built for a private server. He is largely
experimental and is constantly evolving with new features I add in an attempt
to expand my Python knowledge.

As of right now, many of his features likely would not make sense in the context
of any other servers, though if you still would like to use any of them feel
free to do so. I will ask, however, that you please do not use or re-host Gary
elsewhere without first asking me.

I will try to keep this repository as up-to-date as possible when adding new
updates.
